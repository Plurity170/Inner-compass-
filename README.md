# Inner Compass

Inner Compass is a simple life-reflection game built with code.

There are no right or wrong answers here—only choices, direction,
and the quiet consequences that follow.

Each situation presents a moment from everyday life.
Each response reveals a likely outcome and a piece of wisdom.
The game continues, just like life does.

## Why this exists
This project grew out of daily reflection and coding practice.
It explores how small decisions shape clarity, calm, and discipline over time.

## How it works
- Read a situation
- Choose a response
- Reflect on the consequence
- Continue forward

No scores. No endings. Just direction.

## Built with
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Hosted on GitHub Pages

## Status
In active development.
New scenarios are added gradually.
Direction is better than power.
